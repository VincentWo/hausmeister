# Hausmeister, an open Authentication Solution

Ever started a shiny new project and spend the first 2 weeks designing a Login, Register, Password-Forget, ... Screen just to get a probably not very secure and/or usable solution in the end?

Hausmeister tries to solve this problem by being a user __and__ developer friendly self-hostable software allowing you to have SSO, 2-Factor Auth, password resets, WebAuthn, Admin Accounts, and much more.

It consists of a backend written in Rust and a frontend written in Svelte, instructions how to set up these softwares are in the directories.
